Here is my analysis of both documents and the case for consolidation.

## Analysis: UX Design Spec Documents

### Document Inventory

| File | Date | Status | Scope |
|---|---|---|---|
| `ux-design-specification.md` | 2026-02-08 | Original, partially superseded | Foundational UX: personas, emotional design, design system, mode switcher, three interaction modes |
| `ux-financial-statements-spec.md` | 2026-02-16 | v3 active, current architecture | Navigation model, financial statements experience, component architecture, accessibility |
| `tech-spec-5.2-progressive-disclosure-gaps.md` | 2026-02-17 | Done | Implementation gaps in Story 5.2 drill-down |

### Critical Conflicts Between the Two Main Specs

These are not minor divergences — they are incompatible architectural decisions:

**1. Navigation Architecture**

| Original (Feb 8) | Financial Statements Spec v3 (Feb 16) |
|---|---|
| Segmented control: **Planning Assistant \| Forms \| Quick Entry** is the top-level workspace switcher | **No mode switcher exists.** Sidebar items `My Plan` and `Reports` are two navigation destinations, not modes |
| Three "modes" are user-facing feature labels | "My Plan" and "Reports" are routes, not modes. No `planningMode` state |

A developer reading the original spec would build a mode switcher. The financial spec explicitly states: *"If you find yourself writing `if (mode === 'quick-entry')`, you are violating this spec."*

**2. Quick Entry / Expert Mode**

| Original | v3 |
|---|---|
| Expert Mode = purpose-built TanStack Table grid, ~60+ rows, keyboard-first tab-through | **Quick Entry as a concept is retired.** `quick-entry-mode.tsx` is retired. Inline editing in Reports replaces it entirely |
| "A purpose-built financial grid — NOT an adapted table" | The P&L tab in Reports IS the power-user editing surface |

**3. AI Planning Assistant**

| Original | v3 |
|---|---|
| Story Mode = split-screen interaction, left panel = AI conversation, right panel = live dashboard; it's one of the three top-level modes | AI planning assistant = a **feature** within My Plan, available as a slide-in panel or floating button. Also accessible as `Talk to [Manager Name]` sidebar item. NOT a separate workspace mode |
| Described in extensive interaction flow detail | Not redesigned in v3 — its repositioning is implied but not explicitly reworked |

**4. Document Preview Placement**

| Original | v3 |
|---|---|
| Live document preview visible "during planning" throughout the workspace | Preview is specifically on the **Dashboard widget** + accessible from My Plan's Impact Strip. Reports gets only a "Generate PDF" button — preview inside financial statements is explicitly rejected as redundant |

### What Is Still Valid in the Original Spec

These sections are not superseded and remain the authoritative source:

- **Personas** (Sam, Maria, Chris) — v3 references them; their definitions in the original remain accurate
- **Experience Principles** (5 principles) — not touched by v3
- **Emotional design** — emotional arcs, micro-emotions, failure state design (bad ROI, AI extraction errors, advisor disagreement) — fully valid, not addressed in v3
- **Design system** — Tailwind + shadcn/ui, `<FinancialValue>` primitive, white-label theming, CSS token architecture
- **UX pattern analysis** — Notion, Linear, Mercury, Intercom, Shopify analogues, anti-patterns table
- **Visual Design Foundation** — color system, typography, financial formatting conventions
- **Platform strategy** — desktop-first, 1024px min viewport; v3 expands this but doesn't contradict it
- **Auto-save, brand defaults, per-field reset patterns**
- **AI extraction confidence threshold** (high/tentative/uncertain) — still valid wherever the AI assistant exists

### Why Consolidation Is the Right Call

**Confusion risk is real.** A developer or new team member reading the original spec gets a fundamentally different product picture than what's being built. The original describes a three-mode segmented control workspace. The current architecture is a two-destination sidebar app. These are not stylistic differences.

**Two authoritative sources for overlapping topics is fragile.** When a question arises like "where does document preview live?" there are two docs that give different answers.

**The financial statements spec explicitly obsoletes pieces of the original** (retires `quick-entry-mode.tsx`, retires the mode switcher, rewrites story assignments) — but it doesn't update the original spec. That means the original sits unreachable in its original state, potentially re-introducing retired concepts.

**The original has irreplaceable content** that must survive. The financial statements spec has no emotional design section, no pattern analysis, no design system specification. A consolidated doc would be the only complete picture.

### Proposed Structure for Consolidated Spec

```
Part 1:  Project Vision + White-Label Strategy        (from original)
Part 2:  Personas                                     (from original, journeys updated from v3)
Part 3:  Experience Principles                        (from original)
Part 4:  Emotional Design + Failure States            (from original)
Part 5:  Platform Strategy                            (from original + v3 responsive section)
Part 6:  Design System + Visual Design Foundation     (from original)
Part 7:  Navigation Architecture (Two-Door Model)     (from v3 — SUPERSEDES mode switcher)
Part 8:  My Plan Experience (forms + Impact Strip)    (from v3, informed by original Normal Mode)
Part 9:  AI Planning Assistant (as feature, not mode) (from original Story Mode, repositioned)
Part 10: Reports Experience (financial statements)    (from v3 Parts 1-9)
Part 11: Scenario Comparison                          (from v3)
Part 12: Guardian Bar + Dynamic Interpretation        (from v3)
Part 13: Document Preview + PDF Generation            (from v3)
Part 14: Empty + Incomplete States                    (from v3)
Part 15: User Journey Tracing                         (from v3 Part 13)
Part 16: Component Architecture                       (from v3 Part 10)
Part 17: Accessibility                                (from v3 Part 15)
Part 18: UX Pattern Analysis + Anti-Patterns          (from original)
Part 19: Out of Scope + Deferred Items                (from v3 Part 14)
```

### Recommendation

**Yes — consolidate.** The two documents cannot coexist as equals. The financial statements spec is the current architecture. The original spec has essential content that needs to be preserved but integrated. A single consolidated document would:

1. Eliminate the mode-switcher/two-door conflict as a source of developer confusion
2. Preserve the emotional design, principles, and design system content from the original
3. Clarify the AI planning assistant's repositioned role
4. Serve as the single source of truth for Epic 5 and beyond

**Do you want me to produce the consolidated document?** I can write it to `_bmad-output/planning-artifacts/ux-design-specification-consolidated.md` (or replace the original) and push it to the `claude/review-design-specs-dDahW` branch. The work would integrate both documents, flag the architectural supersessions clearly, and preserve all content that remains valid.
