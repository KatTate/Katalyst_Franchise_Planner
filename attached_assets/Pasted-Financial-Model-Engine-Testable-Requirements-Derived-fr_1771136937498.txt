Financial Model Engine — Testable Requirements
Derived from the PostNet and Ubreakifix Business Plan spreadsheets. Each requirement is written so you can feed inputs into the engine and assert specific outputs.

1. INPUT ASSUMPTIONS (Data the engine must accept)
1.1 Global Parameters

Company Name (string)
Start of Business Operations (date, e.g. 8/1/2024)
Financial Year End (date, e.g. 7/31/2025)
Gross Sales / Average Unit Volume (AUV) (currency, e.g. $322,401 PostNet, $526,994 Ubreakifix)
Time to Reach AUV (integer months, e.g. 14 or 18)
Starting Month AUV % (percentage, e.g. 8.0% or 30.0%)
Corporation Tax Rate (percentage, e.g. 21.0%)
EBITDA Multiple (decimal, e.g. 5.0x)
Accounts Receivable Days (integer, e.g. 30)
Accounts Payable Days — Materials (integer, e.g. 60)
Inventory Days (integer, e.g. 60)
Fixed Assets Depreciation Rate (percentage, e.g. 25.0%)
Tax Payment Delay (integer months, e.g. 9)

1.2 Per-Year Assumptions (Years 1–5)

Revenue: Annual Growth Rate (% of Revenue)
Franchise Fees: Royalty Fee (% of Revenue), Marketing/Ad Fund Fee (% of Revenue)
Operating Expenses: Materials COGs (% of Revenue), Direct Labor Cost (% of Revenue), Facilities (),Marketing(), Marketing (% of Revenue), Management & Admin Salaries (
),Marketing(), Payroll Taxes & Benefits (% of Direct Labor Cost + Mgmt/Admin Salaries), Other Operating Expenses (% of Revenue)

P&L Calculations: Target Pre-tax Profit (% of Revenue), Shareholder salary adjustment ($ or 0)

1.3 Investment & Financing (Year 1 only)

Total Investment Required (),brokeninto:CapExInvestments(), broken into: CapEx Investments (
),brokeninto:CapExInvestments(), Non-CapEx Investments (),WorkingCapital/AdditionalFunds(), Working Capital / Additional Funds (
),WorkingCapital/AdditionalFunds()

Equity / Cash Injection ($)
Debt ($)
Debt Term (months, e.g. 144)
Debt Interest Rate (percentage, e.g. 10.5%)

1.4 Distributions (Per-Year)

Estimated Distributions from the Company ($ per year, years 1–5)


2. REVENUE RAMP-UP MODEL
2.1 Two-Phase Revenue Calculation
The model uses a two-phase approach controlled by the "Time to Reach AUV" parameter:

Phase 1 — Ramp Up: From operations start until the AUV target month is reached. Monthly revenue = (Ramp_Up_% × AUV) / 12, where Ramp_Up_% interpolates linearly from Starting Month AUV % to 100% over the ramp-up period.
Phase 2 — Growth: After AUV is reached. Monthly revenue = AUV / 12 × (1 + Annual_Growth_Rate / 12).

2.2 Testable Assertions

Given AUV=$322,401, Starting AUV%=8%, Time to Reach AUV=14 months → Month 1 revenue should be approximately $2,149 (8% × $322,401 / 12).
Year 1 annual revenue must equal the sum of 12 monthly revenue values (from the operations start date through fiscal year end).
After ramp-up completes, the annual growth rates from Input Assumptions (13%, 13%, 10%, 8%, 8%) should drive year-over-year growth.
PostNet Year 1 total revenue = $161,738; Year 5 = $448,684. Ubreakifix Year 1 = $190,009; these are the known-good outputs.


3. PROFIT & LOSS STATEMENT
3.1 Cost of Goods Sold

Materials = Revenue × Materials COGs %
Royalties = Revenue × Royalty Fee %
Ad Fund / Brand Fund = Revenue × Marketing/Ad Fund %
Total COGS = Materials + Royalties + Ad Fund

3.2 Gross Profit

Gross Profit = Revenue − Total COGS
Gross Profit % should equal 1 − (Materials% + Royalty% + Ad Fund%). For PostNet: 1 − (30% + 5% + 2%) = 63.0%.

3.3 Direct Labor

Direct Labor = Revenue × Direct Labor Cost %
Direct LER (Labor Efficiency Ratio) = Revenue / Direct Labor (e.g., 3.7 for PostNet)

3.4 Contribution Margin

Contribution Margin = Gross Profit − Direct Labor
Contribution Margin as % of GP should be consistent (e.g., 46.0% of GP for PostNet; 73.0% for PostNet's "as % of GP" row).

3.5 Operating Expenses (OPEX)

Facilities = flat $ amount per year (from assumptions), allocated monthly as Annual $ / 12
Marketing = Revenue × Marketing %
Management & Admin Salaries = flat $ per year (allocated monthly; $0 in Year 1 if shareholder is unpaid, then increases in subsequent years)
Payroll Taxes & Benefits = (Direct Labor + Mgmt/Admin Salaries) × Payroll Tax %
Other Operating Expenses = Revenue × Other OpEx %
Non-CapEx Investments = one-time charge in Year 1 only (monthly: full amount allocated to the months of operations)
Total OPEX = sum of all operating expense line items

3.6 Net Operating Income (EBITDA)

EBITDA = Contribution Margin − Total OPEX
PostNet Year 1 EBITDA = ($38,414); Year 5 = $74,892

3.7 Depreciation & Amortization

Annual depreciation = CapEx × Fixed Assets Depreciation Rate
PostNet: $132,132 × 25% = $33,033/year for 4 years, then $0 when fully depreciated

3.8 Interest Expense

Calculated monthly on the declining debt balance
Annual interest rate / 12 = monthly rate
PostNet: 10.5% annual → 0.875%/month on remaining principal

3.9 Net Profit Before Tax

Net PBT = EBITDA − Depreciation − Interest Expense
PostNet Year 1 = ($92,096); Year 5 = $61,426

3.10 Adjusted Net Profit Before Tax

Adj Net PBT = Net PBT − Shareholder Salary Adjustment
If shareholder takes no salary (adjustment = $55,000 in Year 1), then Adj Net PBT = Net PBT − $55,000
In years where adjustment = $0, Adj Net PBT = Net PBT

3.11 Corporation Tax

Applied at the Corporation Tax Rate (21%) on profits
Loss carry-forward: losses in one year reduce taxable income in future years
Tax Payment Delay: tax liability is paid with a delay (e.g., 9 months)


4. BALANCE SHEET
4.1 Current Assets

Cash = derived from Cash Flow Statement ending cash balance
Accounts Receivable = Revenue × (AR Days / 365), calculated monthly as Monthly Revenue × AR Days / 30
Inventory = COGS × (Inventory Days / 365), calculated monthly as Monthly COGS × Inventory Days / 60
Other Current Assets = similar working capital calculation

4.2 Fixed Assets

Equipment = CapEx investment amount (constant across years)
Accumulated Depreciation increases each year by the annual depreciation amount
Net Book Value = Equipment − Accumulated Depreciation. When fully depreciated, NBV = $0.

4.3 Current Liabilities

Accounts Payable = Materials Cost × (AP Days / 365), calculated monthly
Tax Payable = deferred tax amounts based on payment delay

4.4 Long-Term Liabilities

Notes Payable = remaining debt principal balance (declining over time with repayments)

4.5 Capital / Equity

Common Stock = Equity injection amount (constant)
Retained Earnings = cumulative Net Income less Distributions
Total Liabilities + Equity must equal Total Assets (balance sheet must balance)

4.6 Testable Assertions

PostNet Year 1 Total Assets = $160,861; Year 5 = $129,445
Total Assets = Total Liabilities + Shareholders' Equity for every period
A/R DSO should be based on trailing 2 months of sales


5. CASH FLOW STATEMENT
5.1 Operating Cash Flows

Start with Net Income
Add back: Depreciation (non-cash)
Adjust for working capital changes: ΔAccounts Receivable, ΔInventory, ΔOther Current Assets, ΔAccounts Payable, ΔTax Payable
Net Cash from Operations = Net Income + Depreciation + Working Capital Changes

5.2 Investing Cash Flows

Purchase of Fixed Assets = CapEx (Year 1 only for initial setup)
Net Cash from Investing = −CapEx

5.3 Financing Cash Flows

Debt Drawdown (Year 1)
Debt Repayment (monthly, consistent amount)
Line of Credit (if applicable)
Interest Expense (already captured in P&L but also shown here)
Distributions to owners
Equity Issuance (Year 1)
Net Cash from Financing = Drawdown − Repayments − Distributions + Equity Issuance

5.4 Net Cash Flow

Net Cash Flow = Operating + Investing + Financing
Ending Cash = Beginning Cash + Net Cash Flow
PostNet Year 1 Ending Cash = $25,369; Year 5 = $68,979


6. DEBT SCHEDULE
6.1 Primary Debt (Debt 1)

Opening Balance, Drawdown, Repayment, Closing Balance tracked monthly
Monthly repayment = Debt Amount / Debt Term Months (straight-line amortization, e.g. $205,206 / 144 months = ~$1,425/month for PostNet)
Interest Expense calculated monthly on opening balance: Opening Balance × (Annual Rate / 12)
PostNet Debt 1: Opening = $205,206; monthly repayment = $17,100/year ÷ 12

6.2 Support for Multiple Debt Tranches

The model supports up to 3 debt instruments (Debt 1, Debt 2, Debt 3)
Each with independent opening balance, drawdown, repayment, and interest calculations
Total Interest = sum of interest across all debt tranches


7. CAPITAL EXPENDITURE & DEPRECIATION
7.1 CapEx Schedule (Per Year, Years 1–5)

Opening NBV, Expenditure, Depreciation, Closing NBV tracked per year
Depreciation = Expenditure × Depreciation Rate
Closing NBV = Opening NBV + Expenditure − Depreciation
Total Expenditure, Total Depreciation, and Total Net Book Value are summed across all year-layers

7.2 Testable Assertions

PostNet: CapEx = $132,132. At 25% depreciation: Year 1 depreciation = $33,033; NBV Year 1 = $99,099; fully depreciated by Year 4 (NBV = $0).


8. WORKING CAPITAL MODEL
8.1 Accounts Receivable

Monthly AR Closing = Monthly Revenue × (AR Days / 30)
AR Days sourced from Input Assumptions (e.g., 30 days)

8.2 Accounts Payable

Separate payable calculations for: Materials, Ad Fund/Brand Fund, Royalties, and Labor + Payroll
Each uses its own AP Days parameter
AP Closing = Monthly Expense × (AP Days / 30)
Total AP = sum of all payable sub-components

8.3 Inventory

Monthly Inventory Closing = Monthly COGS × (Inventory Days / 30)

8.4 Net Working Capital

Working Capital = AR + Inventory − AP
PostNet Year 1 Working Capital = $22,843


9. RETURNS ON INVESTED CAPITAL (ROIC)
9.1 Invested Capital

Outside Cash (Equity Injected) — constant across years
Total Loans (Debt Injected) — constant across years
Total Cash Invested = Equity + Debt
Total Sweat Equity = additional non-cash investment (constant, e.g., $55,000)
Retained Earnings (less distributions) — cumulative
Total Invested Capital = Total Cash Invested + Sweat Equity + Retained Earnings

9.2 ROIC Calculation

ROIC = Pre-Tax Net Income / Total Invested Capital
PostNet Year 1 ROIC = (67.0%); Year 5 = 24.8%

9.3 Core Capital Metrics

Average Total Core Capital per Month
Months of Core Capital = how many months of operating expenses the core capital covers
Excess Core Capital = surplus above a 2-month opex target


10. VALUATION
10.1 EBITDA-Based Valuation

Uses EBITDA Multiple from assumptions (e.g., 5.0x)
Gross Sales × multiple is NOT the method — it uses Adj Net Operating Income × EBITDA Multiple
Revenue (Gross Sales) shown for context
Net Operating Income = EBITDA from P&L
Shareholder salary adjustment applied
Adj Net Operating Income = Net Operating Income − Salary Adjustment (if applicable)
Adj Net Operating Income as % of Revenue shown

10.2 Estimated Business Value

Estimated Value = Adj Net Operating Income × EBITDA Multiple
Estimated taxes on sale (21% of estimated value)
Net After-Tax Proceeds from Sale = Estimated Value − Taxes on Sale
Replacement return required (benchmark, e.g., 25.3%)
Business Annual ROIC for comparison


11. BREAKEVEN ANALYSIS
11.1 Breakeven Point

Defined as the operational month where cumulative net operating cash flow turns positive
Breakeven Date = specific month/year (e.g., Oct-25 for PostNet)
Number of Months to Breakeven (e.g., 15 months for PostNet)

11.2 Burn Metrics

Total Expenses = cumulative operating expenses until breakeven
CapEx = total capital expenditure
Total Burn = Total Expenses + CapEx (e.g., PostNet: $82,532 + $132,132 = $214,664)


12. LABOR EFFICIENCY
12.1 Direct LER

Direct LER = Revenue / Direct Labor Cost (target: 3.7 for PostNet across all years)

12.2 Admin LER

Admin LER Forecasted = Revenue / Mgmt & Admin Salaries
Admin LER Benchmark = 2.0 (constant target)
Difference = Forecasted − Benchmark

12.3 Adjusted Total LER

Adj Total LER = Revenue / (Direct Labor + Adjusted Mgmt/Admin Wages)
Benchmark = 2.0; Difference tracked

12.4 Salary Cap

Salary Cap @ target pre-tax profit % (e.g., 15%)
(Over)/Under cap = Salary Cap − Adjusted Total Wages


13. MONTHLY vs. ANNUAL AGGREGATION
13.1 Time Structure

The engine must compute all values at a monthly granularity for 60 months (5 fiscal years)
Annual figures = sum of 12 monthly values within each fiscal year
Fiscal year boundaries are defined by the Financial Year End date (e.g., 7/31 means Year 1 = Aug-24 through Jul-25)

13.2 Column Structure

Monthly columns are labeled by month-year (Aug-24, Sep-24, …, Jul-29)
Annual columns labeled Year 1 through Year 5 with fiscal year date ranges


14. CROSS-BRAND CONSISTENCY
14.1 Same Structure, Different Inputs

The engine must produce correct outputs for any franchise brand by changing only the Input Assumptions
PostNet (AUV=$322,401, 5% royalty, 30% materials, 17% labor) and Ubreakifix (AUV=$526,994, 7% royalty, 32% materials, 15% labor) both use the identical calculation logic
No brand-specific hard-coding allowed

14.2 Validation Checks

Check: Total Investment = CapEx + Non-CapEx + Working Capital
Check: Equity + Debt ≥ Total Investment Required
Check: Balance Sheet balances (Assets = Liabilities + Equity) every month
Check: Cash Flow ending cash = Balance Sheet cash every month
Check: Annual totals = sum of monthly values for that fiscal year


This gives you roughly 80+ discrete, testable assertions you can write as unit/integration tests against your Financial Model Engine. Each section maps to a specific spreadsheet tab or calculation block and can be validated against the known PostNet and Ubreakifix reference data.
