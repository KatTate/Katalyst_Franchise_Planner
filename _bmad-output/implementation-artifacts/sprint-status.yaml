# STATUS DEFINITIONS:
# ==================
# Epic Status:
#   - backlog: Epic not yet started
#   - in-progress: Epic actively being worked on
#   - done: All stories in epic completed
#
# Epic Status Transitions:
#   - backlog → in-progress: Automatically when first story is created (via create-story)
#   - in-progress → done: Manually when all stories reach 'done' status
#
# Story Status:
#   - backlog: Story only exists in epic file
#   - ready-for-dev: Story file created in stories folder
#   - in-progress: Developer actively working on implementation
#   - review: Ready for code review (via Dev's code-review workflow)
#   - done: Story completed
#
# Retrospective Status:
#   - optional: Can be completed but not required
#   - done: Retrospective has been completed
#
# WORKFLOW NOTES:
# ===============
# - Epic transitions to 'in-progress' automatically when first story is created
# - Stories can be worked in parallel if team capacity allows
# - SM typically creates next story after previous one is 'done' to incorporate learnings
# - Dev moves story to 'review', then runs code-review (fresh context, different LLM recommended)

# 2026-02-21: Story 5H.3 audit executed (Dev Story workflow)
#   - 9 journey steps mapped across Journeys 1, 2, 3, 5
#   - 8 gaps identified: GAP-01 (DRAFT threshold mismatch), GAP-02 (missing middle
#     tier), GAP-03 (subjective formatting), GAP-04 (no journey for doc history),
#     GAP-05 (no error state ACs), GAP-06 (thumbnail underspecified), GAP-07 (missing
#     IStorage immutability reference), GAP-08 (missing Audit section in PDF)

#     H1: BS identity check name mismatch in callout-bar.tsx — search predicate "balance sheet" didn't match engine's "BS identity" names. Always showed "Balanced". Fixed with filter()+every() on "bs identity".
#     M1: e2e test file added to story File List (was undocumented)
#     M2: Dev agent AC-2 evidence was invalid — Playwright test passed vacuously due to H1 bug (documented as noted finding)
#     L1: Unused useMemo import removed from roic-tab.tsx; unused ArrowDown import removed from balance-sheet-tab.tsx
#   - Step 4: LSP diagnostics — 0 errors, 0 warnings. Architect review completed.

  # ==========================================================================
  # NEW EPICS (added via Sprint Change Proposal 2026-02-15)
  # ==========================================================================

  # Epic 5: Financial Statement Views & Output Layer [NEW]
  # Two interaction surfaces (My Plan + Reports) over shared financial input state
  # Dependencies: Epic 3 (engine), Epic 4 (planning workspace)
  # Pre-req: CP-2 engine extension (Story 5.1), CP-8 tech debt resolution
  # UX design authority: ux-design-specification-consolidated.md (2026-02-18)
  # FRs: FR7a-FR7m, FR84-FR97 (updated per SCP-2026-02-20 document remediation)
  # Stories: 9 (Story 5.7 RETIRED → Epic 10)
  # All 9 stories done + CP-11 confirmed. Epic 5 COMPLETE.
  # CODE REVIEW GAP (CRITICAL — flagged by Product Owner):
  # Only 5.1, 5.2, 5.3, 5.5 had formal adversarial code reviews.
  # Stories 5.4, 5.6, 5.8, 5.9, 5.10 were NEVER formally code-reviewed.
  # CP-7 re-verified ACs for 5.6-5.10 but did NOT run adversarial code review.
  # ADDITIONALLY: The 4 reviewed stories (5.1-5.3, 5.5) were reviewed BEFORE
  # SCP-2026-02-20 remediation edits (CP-1 through CP-13) modified their code.
  # Post-remediation code has NOT been reviewed by any formal process.
  # Net result: NO story in Epic 5 has a code review reflecting current code state.
  # Retrospective MUST assess whether full code reviews are needed before next epic.
