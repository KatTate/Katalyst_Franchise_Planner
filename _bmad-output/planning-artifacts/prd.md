# Product Requirements Document - Katalyst Franchise Planning Toolbox

**Author:** User
**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Project Classification

- **Project Type:** B2B2C Vertical SaaS Platform
- **Domain:** Franchise Operations with Financial Planning & Analysis engine
- **Complexity:** High — primary driver is configurability (brand-configurable financial engine, UX, documents, wizard steps, educational content), compounded by multi-stakeholder data isolation ("the throuple problem"), complex location lifecycle state management, and FTC compliance constraints on content positioning
- **Project Context:** Greenfield

**Key Classification Notes:**
- Not fintech — no money handling, no financial regulation. Fintech-adjacent document accuracy requirements (lender-grade outputs must be mathematically correct) and FTC content positioning constraints
- B2B2C, not B2B — buyer (franchisor) is not the primary user (franchisee). Three distinct user tiers (franchisee, franchisor admin, Katalyst admin) with completely different UX needs, essentially three different products sharing one data layer
- Configurability is the primary complexity driver — not security or compliance. The financial engine, UX layers, document templates, wizard steps, and educational content must all be configurable per brand
