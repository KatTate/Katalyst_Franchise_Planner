# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** User
**Date:** 2026-02-08

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Customizable software toolbox for franchise brands to guide franchisee owners through ROI calculation, forecasting, and planning for new location openings

**Goals:** Find the best way to guide franchisees step-by-step through ROI calculation, financial forecasting, and location planning — packaged as a customizable product Katalyst can deploy across franchise brand clients

### Context Guidance

_Katalyst is a Franchise Scale Partner that helps brick-and-mortar franchise brands open more stores, faster, with reproducible results. Their frameworks (QuickBrick, Balanced Servicescape, 5-Gear) inform how location planning should work. The PostNet Business Plan workbook provides the financial model template. The tool should embody the franchisee-first philosophy and serve as a digital extension of Katalyst's physical-world services for brands opening 10-50 locations/year._

### Session Setup

_Session established with clear focus on building a customizable software toolbox that Katalyst can white-label and deploy for each franchise brand client. Starting with PostNet as the reference model, using their Business Plan workbook as the data foundation. The tool will guide franchisees through the financial decision-making journey of opening a new location._

## Technique Selection

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques
**Analysis Context:** Customizable franchise location planning toolbox with focus on guiding franchisees through ROI, forecasting, and planning

**Recommended Techniques:**

- **Role Playing (collaborative):** Walk through each stakeholder perspective (franchisee, franchisor, Katalyst) to surface needs and pain points that inform product design
- **SCAMPER Method (structured):** Systematically innovate on the PostNet Business Plan workbook model — Substitute, Combine, Adapt, Modify, Put to other uses, Eliminate, Reverse — to transform a static spreadsheet into interactive digital tools
- **Morphological Analysis (deep):** Map key product dimensions (inputs, calculations, outputs, customization layers) and explore combinations to identify the most compelling MVP toolbox

**AI Rationale:** This sequence moves from empathy (understanding users) to generation (creating feature ideas) to structure (organizing into a product vision). It's designed for a multi-stakeholder B2B product with complex financial workflows that need to be both powerful and accessible.
