# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** User (Tate Fisher, Katalyst)
**Date:** 2026-02-08

---

## Session Overview

**Topic:** Customizable software toolbox for franchise brands to guide franchisee owners through ROI calculation, forecasting, and planning for new location openings

**Goals:** Find the best way to guide franchisees step-by-step through ROI calculation, financial forecasting, and location planning — packaged as a customizable product Katalyst can deploy across franchise brand clients

### Context

Katalyst is a Franchise Scale Partner that helps brick-and-mortar franchise brands open more stores, faster, with reproducible results. Their frameworks (QuickBrick, Balanced Servicescape, 5-Gear) inform how location planning should work. The PostNet Business Plan workbook provides the financial model template. The tool should embody the franchisee-first philosophy and serve as a digital extension of Katalyst's physical-world services for brands opening 10-50 locations/year.

### Techniques Used

- **Role Playing (collaborative):** Explored franchisee, franchisor, and Katalyst perspectives
- **SCAMPER Method (structured):** Systematically innovated on the PostNet Business Plan workbook
- **Morphological Analysis (deep):** Mapped product dimensions and identified MVP scope

---

## Product Thesis

**This is not a business plan calculator.** It is a guided self-assessment journey that empowers franchisees to build their own location plan, understand the real drivers of ROI (especially space and construction), and naturally discover when they need expert help — all while keeping the franchisee in the driver's seat legally and psychologically.

The tool serves three stakeholders simultaneously:

1. **Franchisee value** — Makes planning doable instead of overwhelming; produces real financial documents; tracks progress over time
2. **Franchisor value** — Gives them a tangible product to hand franchisees that improves location success rates; provides development pipeline visibility
3. **Katalyst value** — Creates earlier engagement by revealing complexity the franchisee didn't know they'd face; generates lead flow at exactly the right moment; creates a chargeable product for franchise brands

---

## Core Design Principles

### 1. Empowerment Over Handholding
The tool guides franchisees to make informed decisions, not decisions for them. Every number, every assumption, every choice belongs to the franchisee. If the tool does too much for them, it creates dependency and blame-shifting when reality diverges from the pro forma.

### 2. Guide-Not-Do Pattern
The tool acts like a knowledgeable guide on a hike — pointing out terrain, warning about risks, suggesting routes — but the franchisee walks. It prompts, educates, visualizes impact, and lets them decide. It does not collect inputs and generate outputs.

### 3. Layered Complexity
Financial modeling IS complex because it should be. The tool provides a high-level summary layer that lets franchisees click into full detail. Summary for confidence, detail for due diligence, education for empowerment.

### 4. FTC Compliance by Design
The tool must be designed with FTC Franchise Rule boundaries baked in. It cannot make promises or projections on behalf of the franchisor. The franchisee drives all assumptions and owns all outputs. This legal constraint becomes a design strength aligned with the empowerment philosophy.

### 5. The Pro Forma Is Always Wrong
Every output should present ranges (good/better/best), not single numbers. The tool prepares franchisees for variance and builds resilience into how they think about their financial future.

## Complete Idea Inventory — Organized by Theme

### Theme 1: Franchisee Experience & Psychology

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | The Overwhelm Wall | Franchisees face a wall of spreadsheet — too many tabs, too many fields, no guidance. The tool's primary job is reducing the psychological barrier to actually planning. |
| 2 | The "Wing It" Default | Without guidance, franchisees default to projecting current location numbers onto new ones — dangerous because different spaces, markets, and timelines create different financial profiles. |
| 3 | The Space-Construction-ROI Triangle | Franchisees don't naturally connect how space choice, construction process, and timeline cascade into ROI. These feel like separate decisions but are deeply linked. |
| 9 | Empowerment Over Handholding | The tool should empower, not do it for them. Too much automation creates dependency and blame-shifting when reality diverges from the pro forma. |
| 10 | The Ownership-Accountability Loop | When franchisees build the plan themselves (with guidance), they psychologically own outcomes and troubleshoot instead of blame when things diverge. |
| 11 | The Guide-Not-Do Design Pattern | Prompt, educate, visualize impact, let them decide. Not: collect inputs, generate outputs. |

### Theme 2: Entry Points & Onboarding

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 37 | The 5-Input Quick ROI | Enter franchise brand, target market, investment budget, target opening date, single/multi-unit. Get a preliminary ROI range in under 2 minutes. Front-load value, not complexity. |
| 47 | Start with the Answer, Work Backward (Reverse Goal-Setting) | "What ROI do you need?" The tool works backward to reveal requirements: revenue needed, market density required, maximum buildout cost. Franchisee sets the goal, tool reveals the path. |
| 22 | The "Tell Us About Your Deal" Onboarding | Friendly guided intake: how many locations, target markets, identified sites, contractual deadlines. Feels like conversation, not data entry. |
| 21 | Multi-Unit Development Schedule Intake | Early prompt for full development schedule — locations, target dates, known details. Captures data Katalyst always struggles to collect, organically. |

### Theme 3: Financial Engine & ROI Modeling

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 12 | Good-Better-Best Scenario Planning | Every ROI output presents three scenarios (conservative, moderate, optimistic) so the franchisee sees a range, not a false promise. |
| 13 | Sensitivity Visualization — "What Moves the Needle" | Show which variables have the biggest ROI impact. Visual sliders or tornado charts. Naturally draws attention to space and construction — where Katalyst adds the most value. |
| 14 | The "Survive the Worst Case" Gut Check | After building the plan: "In the conservative scenario, can you financially survive the first 18 months?" Empowerment through confronting uncomfortable truths. |
| 15 | Dynamic Range, Not Static Tiers | Let franchisees adjust confidence level/risk tolerance and watch the range expand or contract. They control their own risk appetite. |
| 49 | Financial Document Production Engine | Produces actual lender-ready documents: pro forma P&L, cash flow projections, balance sheets, break-even analyses. From planning tool to complete financial package. |
| 50 | Financial Literacy Layers | Contextual education on every financial document and metric. Tooltips, explainers, walkthroughs. Available when the franchisee wants to understand — not forced. |
| 51 | The ROI Threshold Guardian | Persistent red/yellow/green indicator. Franchisee sets acceptable ROI range; every decision that pushes toward the bottom triggers a warning. Real-time feedback, self-correction as they go. |

### Theme 4: Living Plan & Multi-Unit Portfolio

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 16 | Estimated vs. Actual — The Living Plan | Plan doesn't end at opening. Franchisee updates with actual numbers; tool recalculates trajectory. Pro forma becomes a living document evolving from "best guess" to "ground truth." |
| 17 | The Multi-Unit Cascade Trigger | For multi-unit deals, tracks when actual cash from location #1 creates funding runway for #2, then #1 + #2 fund #3, etc. "When can I afford to open the next one?" |
| 18 | The Portfolio Compound Effect View | As actual data flows in from multiple locations, shows compounding effect — how the portfolio accelerates or decelerates expansion timeline. |
| 19 | Estimated vs. Actual as Early Warning | When actuals diverge significantly from plan, surfaces the signal and key drivers. Prompts reflection, not panic. |
| 20 | The Readiness Gate for Next Location | Green/yellow/red indicator based on actual cash flow, debt service coverage, and reserves. Creates the natural moment to re-engage planning for the next location. |
| 41 | The Completion Confidence Meter | Visual indicator: "Your plan is 35% based on estimates, 65% based on actual documents." Gamifies the planning process aligned with empowerment philosophy. |

### Theme 5: Site Evaluation & Real Estate

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 28 | Real Estate Guidelines Management Hub | Houses franchisor's criteria: target SF ranges, trade areas, co-tenancy, parking, visibility. Tool checks properties against brand standards automatically. |
| 29 | Address-Based Data Auto-Fill | Enter address, pull demographics, avg rents, traffic, income, density, competition from existing data providers (Placer.ai, CoStar, ESRI, etc.). Flows directly into financial model. |
| 30 | The Site Scorecard | Combines brand criteria with third-party market data. "This location scores 8/10 on your brand's criteria." Score feeds financial plan as risk factor. |
| 31 | Financial Plan + Site Evaluation as One Flow | Enter multiple addresses, see financial projections side by side. Reveals tradeoffs between rent, demographics, buildout, and ROI across candidate sites. |

### Theme 6: Construction & Timeline Planning

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 48 | Reverse Timeline — Plan from Grand Opening Backward | Start from target opening date, work backward to surface every milestone, deadline, and dependency. Meets franchisees where they think. |
| 52 | Last Planner System — Construction Management | Modified Last Planner with pull planning and takt planning. Reverse-engineer from grand opening, align all stakeholders, manage commitments and dependencies. |
| 53 | Construction-to-Finance Live Link | Construction timeline wired to financial model. A 3-week delay automatically recalculates carrying costs, delayed revenue, updated break-even, ROI impact. |
| 54 | Stakeholder Alignment Board | Shared view where every party (architect, GC, permitting, vendors, franchisor, franchisee, Katalyst) sees commitments, dependencies, and connection to grand opening date. |

### Theme 7: Document Intelligence & Storage

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 38 | AI Document Ingestion — Progressive Data Capture | Upload FDD, franchise agreement, lease, construction bids. AI extracts relevant data automatically. Each document "levels up" the plan's accuracy. |
| 39 | The Document Vault — Per Location | Every location gets organized document storage: FDD, lease, contracts, permits, insurance. Solves the universal "where's that document?" pain point. Integration with Google Drive and/or more sophisticated platforms. |
| 40 | Documents as Data — The Auto-Refining Plan | Document vault isn't just storage. Every upload feeds the financial model. Upload a lease, rent auto-populates. Upload a bid, buildout costs flow in. Plan self-assembles as documents are collected. |

### Theme 8: Financing & Capital Marketplace

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 32 | The Franchise Finance Marketplace | Integrate with franchise lenders (FranFund, Benetrends, Guidant, ApplePie, etc.). Franchisee fills out financial profile once, submits to multiple lenders. LendingTree for franchise funding. |
| 33 | Real-Time Rate & Terms Comparison | Pull current rates, SBA terms, equipment financing, working capital products. Display side by side. Each option auto-recalculates ROI projection. |
| 34 | Single Application, Multiple Lenders | Franchisee's plan data becomes a pre-packaged lending application. One click sends to selected finance partners. Finance companies get higher-quality leads with complete business plans. |
| 35 | The PE/Family Office Deal Flow Pipeline | Multi-unit operators with proven performance (actual data in the tool) become visible to capital partners. Investment platform layer on top of planning tool. |
| 36 | The Syndicated Deal Builder | Operators raising capital for next locations get a tool to structure the deal — portfolio performance, development schedule, projected returns backed by actual data. Pitch deck meets living financial model. |
| 42 | Franchisor Bridge Financing Pre-Approval | Plan data feeds pre-approval workflow for franchisors offering bridge financing or SBA bridge loans. Speeds up the most painful bottleneck — waiting for financing. |

### Theme 9: Franchisor Configuration & Setup

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 24 | AI-Powered FDD Auto-Intake | Franchisor (via Katalyst setup) uploads FDD; AI extracts Item 19, Item 7, startup costs to pre-populate benchmark data. |
| 25 | Beyond the FDD — Live Network Data | Franchisors upload more current financial data from their operating network, available only to signed franchisees. Two-tier data model: public FDD baseline + confidential network data. |
| 26 | Franchisor-Curated Defaults | Instead of empty fields, tool pre-fills with network averages/ranges. "Based on your brand's network, typical monthly rent is $X-$Y. Adjust for your market." Smart starting points, not answers. |
| 27 | The Signed-Agreement Data Gate | Before signing franchise agreement, franchisees see FDD data only. After signing, they unlock richer benchmarks. Turns legal compliance into a product feature that accelerates the franchise sales cycle. |
| 43 | The Franchisor's Portfolio Health Dashboard | Anonymized, aggregated visibility: how many franchisees are planning, where they're looking, projected timelines, actual performance. Development pipeline they've never had. |

### Theme 10: Strategic & Business Model

| # | Idea | Description |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | The Too-Late Problem | Katalyst typically gets engaged after franchisees have signed a lease. The tool intervenes upstream — before the lease is signed. |
| 5 | The Franchisor Distribution Play | Franchisor provides the tool to franchisees. As they work through it, they hit sections where they need expert help — naturally prompting earlier Katalyst engagement. |
| 6 | The Upstream Intervention Hook | Show franchisees in real numbers how construction decisions change their ROI. Education through consequence modeling creates urgency to get expertise before signing a lease. |
| 8 | Terms & Liability Shield | Terms and Conditions that communicate: this is a planning aid, not financial advice. Covers Katalyst and franchisor. Also a UX moment reinforcing empowerment: "This is YOUR plan." |
| 23 | Development Schedule as Shared Visibility | One data entry, three stakeholders served. Franchisee sees timeline and readiness, franchisor sees pipeline, Katalyst sees engagement opportunities. |
| 44 | Katalyst's Engagement Intelligence | When franchisees reach key milestones (evaluating sites, uploading leases), Katalyst gets data-driven signals for timely outreach instead of cold outreach. |
| 45 | Layer Complexity, Don't Eliminate It | Financial modeling is complex — the tool provides summary layers that click down into full detail. Don't dumb it down, make it navigable. |
| 46 | Eliminate Duplicate Data Entry | Between FDD, franchise agreement, lease, bids, and SBA applications, franchisees enter the same data dozens of times. The tool captures once, pushes everywhere. |

## Regulatory & Legal Boundaries (Hard Rules)

1. **FTC Franchise Rule Compliance:** The tool MUST NOT be used as a franchise sales tool. No financial projections to prospective franchisees. All users must be post-agreement signed franchisees.
2. **No Financial Advice:** Terms and Conditions must clearly state this is a planning aid. Franchisees own all assumptions and outputs. Neither Katalyst nor the franchisor is providing financial advice.
3. **Data Tiers:** FDD-published data available broadly; more current network data available only to signed franchisees with franchisor permission.
4. **Empowerment Mandate:** The tool empowers the franchisee to make their own decisions. It does not make decisions for them or prescribe specific financial outcomes.

## Business Model Notes

- **Katalyst charges the franchisor** for system setup and ongoing platform fees
- **Katalyst performs the franchisor onboarding** (FDD data entry, brand config, benchmark setup) — this is part of the value proposition and justifies the fee
- **Franchisees access the tool through their franchisor** — it's a benefit/resource the franchisor provides
- **Revenue expansion paths:** Finance marketplace referral fees, capital marketplace transaction fees, per-location document management, premium features for multi-unit operators

## Breakthrough Concepts (Highest Impact Ideas)

1. **The Multi-Unit Cascade Trigger (#17)** — Completely unserved need. No one gives multi-unit franchisees a dynamic model showing when their portfolio generates enough cash to trigger the next opening.
2. **Estimated vs. Actual Living Plan (#16)** — Transforms a one-time planning exercise into an ongoing operating dashboard. Creates permanent engagement and recurring value.
3. **The 5-Input Quick ROI (#37)** — Front-loads value instead of complexity. Gets franchisees their first meaningful answer in 2 minutes, drawing them into the deeper planning experience.
4. **Documents as Data (#40)** — Every uploaded document makes the plan smarter. Transforms an administrative chore into a rewarding experience.
5. **ROI Threshold Guardian (#51)** — Persistent red/yellow/green feedback on every decision. Real-time empowerment through consequence visibility.
6. **Reverse Goal-Setting (#47)** — "What ROI do you need?" inverts the entire planning experience. Outcomes first, requirements revealed.

## Next Step: Create Product Brief

This brainstorming session has produced a comprehensive product vision with clear MVP scope, design principles, regulatory boundaries, and a tiered growth path. The natural next step is to formalize this into a **Product Brief** using the BMAD workflow.

**To proceed:** Type **CB** (Create Brief) to begin the product brief workflow, which will draw directly from this brainstorming output.
