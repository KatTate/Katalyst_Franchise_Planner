# Brainstorming Session Results

**Facilitator:** Tate Fisher
**Date:** 2026-02-15

## Session Overview

**Topic:** End-to-end franchisee user journeys — complete workflow mapping with gap analysis against existing PRD and current build

**Goals:**
1. Map every franchisee workflow end-to-end across all three persona tiers (Story/Normal/Expert)
2. Validate what the PRD says against what's actually built
3. Identify what's accurate, what's outdated, and what's missing entirely
4. Specific focus areas: multi-plan management (create/clone/rename), startup costs management, and persona tier differences

**Scope boundary:** Franchisee journeys first. Franchisor and admin journeys come after.

### Context

Building on the Feb 8 brainstorming session (54 ideas) and the full PRD. Sally's retrospective comment identified that feature design has outpaced journey design — we've built capabilities but haven't mapped the complete user paths that connect them. This session grounds discovery in the PRD and current build to produce an actionable gap inventory.

### Techniques Selected

**Approach:** AI-Recommended Techniques

- **Role Playing (collaborative):** Walk in each persona's shoes through the complete app experience — every click, screen, and decision point
- **Question Storming (deep):** Generate every unanswered question about gaps, missing transitions, and unbuilt pathways
- **Decision Tree Mapping (structured):** Map concrete UI flows for multi-plan management, startup costs, plan creation/cloning/renaming

**AI Rationale:** This is a grounded gap-analysis session, not blue-sky ideation. The technique sequence moves from experiential (walking the journeys) to analytical (surfacing questions) to structural (mapping decision trees), ensuring we catch gaps at every level.
